## How It Works

XTTS-v2 is a **multilingual model** trained on phonetics:
- Even when using a "mapped" language (e.g., Ukrainian → Russian)
- XTTS-v2 reads the text and pronounces it correctly
- The accent/voice character comes from the mapped language
- Pronunciation is generally good due to multilingual training

### Example:
- **Ukrainian text:** "Привіт, як справи?"
- **Mapped to:** Russian voice
- **Result:** Pronounced correctly with slight Russian accent
